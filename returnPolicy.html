            In the event where Buyer has commenced legal action against Seller, Buyer may provide the formal notification from the appropriate authority to ELNINA to request ELNINA to continue to hold the purchase monies until a formal determination is available.

            <br>
            When ELNINA receives an application from Buyer for the return of the Item and/or refund, ELNINA will notify Seller in writing. Seller may respond to Buyer’s application according to the steps provided by ELNINA in the written notification. Seller must respond within the time-frame stipulated in the written notification (the “Stipulated Period”). Should ELNINA not hear from Seller within the Stipulated Period, ELNINA will assume that Seller has no response to Buyer’s application and will proceed to assess Buyer’s application without further notice to Seller.

            <br>
